Toy Demo for Golang Meetup

Before you run the main.go, Please install the following package to your go repository:
```
  go get github.com/tangingw/rsacrypto
```

Once you have installed the `rsacrypto` library, compile the `main.go` in the repo:
```
  go build main.go
```

You can play around with the demo by:
```
  python client_public.py <YOUR MESSAGE>
```

To decrypt the message in Golang, you can type:
```
  ./main
```
